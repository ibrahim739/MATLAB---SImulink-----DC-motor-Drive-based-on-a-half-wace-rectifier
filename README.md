# MATLAB---SImulink-----DC-motor-Drive-based-on-a-half-wace-rectifier

DC driver based on a half-wave rectifier

Description:

The model could be sub-divided into three main steps:

1. Running for no-load torque with changing thyristor pulses
2. Running for load torque with changing thyristor pulses
3. Running for no-load torque with changing the fire angle of the thyristor for Armature
